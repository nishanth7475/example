1.Prototype:
Ans:Every JavaScript has a prototype.Protptype is also an object.All JavaScript objects are inherited their methods and properties from  a prototype.JavaScript prototypes are object.prototype and Date.prototype.All JavaScript objects(Date,Array,RedExp…) inherit  from their object.prototype
Eg:creating a prototype
Standard way to write a object.prototype is to use an object construction function:
function Person(first,last,age,eye-color){
this.firstName=first;
this.lastName=last;
this.age=age;
this.eyecolor=eyecolor;
}
var my Father=new person(“Bal reddy”,”Nareddy”,48,”black”);
var my Mother=new person(“Sujatha”,”Nareddy”,45,”black”);
